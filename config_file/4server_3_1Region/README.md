Your Terraform configuration looks good! It creates a VPC with two subnets in the us-east-1 region, each in a different availability zone (us-east-1a and us-east-1b). Then it launches three instances (server_az1_1, server_az1_2, and server_az2) in these subnets, and another instance (server_other_region) in the us-west-2 region.
